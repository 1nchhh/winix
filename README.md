# Winix

I had the idea to have Linux run under the WSL2 kernel and use a Linux desktop environment instead of the normal userinit.exe in Windows. I wanted this to be a full Linux desktop environment, not just a terminal. I also wanted to be able to run Windows applications from the Linux environment.

There are pros and cons to both Windows and Linux, and I wanted to be able to use both at the same time. For example, some games only work on Windows, but I prefer to use Linux for development. I also wanted to be able to use Windows applications from Linux, such as Microsoft Office, Adobe Photoshop, and other applications that don't have Linux versions.
